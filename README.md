PIC 10C final project attempt #3
Please note: this repo was recently created - this is the 3rd iteration of the Final Project that I have attempted, however it uses code/concepts from previous attempts heavily. 

Previous work:

Previous repos started week 6 and week 8, respectively, uploaded to Github later.

Game is similar to the Ballz app on the app store and windows store. Player shoots the ball at blocks, attempts to destroy blocks before they reach the bottom of the scene, when they destruct.
